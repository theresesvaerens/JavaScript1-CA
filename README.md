# JavaScript 1 Course Assignment — Square Eyes
This project is my JavaScript 1 Course Assignment, where the goal was to create an interactive online store using data from an API.
I chose to continue working on my existing Square Eyes project and used the Square Eyes API to dynamically load product data.

The main focus of the assignment was to demonstrate practical JavaScript skills such as fetching data, handling errors, manipulating the DOM, and building interactive features like a shopping basket.

# Project Goal

- Fetch and display products from an API

- Enable users to add/remove items from a shopping basket
- Provide a simple checkout flow
